<hr>

<h1>What can this bot do for you?</h1>
- /help -> Gives you a list of all commands;<br><br>
- /start -> To start the bot or make him say hello to you. He can also recognise the time of the day and adapt his greeting (good morning/good afternoon/good evening/ecc...);<br><br>
- /film &lt;name of a film&gt; -> Under this bot there's also a web scraper programmed to scrape informations on the website "https://www.ilregnodelcinema.com/multisalaportanova". With this command you'll get the informations of every film present on the website, including the posters. If you specify a film, you'll get only that film's infos;<br><br>
- /upcoming -> Same as the previous command, this time you'll get all the upcoming films with their related infos.<br><br>
- At the end you can also try to ask non-command related question to this bot, and he'll do his best to answer you!

<h2>Planned features</h2>
- Adding a weather related set of commands, maybe connecting the bot with APIs;
- Improving the non-command related questions.
